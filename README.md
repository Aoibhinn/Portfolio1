<h1 text-align="center">MYM Website</h1>

The MYM websites aim is to provide informative content to people who want to learn more about becoming more mindful in their day to day lives. The website also offers users the opportunity to register for weekly yoga classes where they can select their level of experience and external links to the creator's favourite mindfulness blogs to help the user become emersed in the world of mindfulness. The UI is simple and clean with imagery focusing on a peaceful, nature theme to ensure the user experience is relaxed and calm.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>

- Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Mindfulness and Sign Up page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
- This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

<h3>Landing Page Image</h3>
The landing page includes an image with a text overlay. The user is met with a calm image of a young woman in a meditation pose with the message "This is your guide to living an authentic lifestyle despite everyday stress." Giving the user a sense of what the website is aiming to provide.
