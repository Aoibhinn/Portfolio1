Design

Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are #083F62 - dark navy and white. 

Typography
The Roboto font is mainly used throughout the website with Sans Serif used as a fallback font incase the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 

Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.
 

Imagery
The imagery used throughout the site is calm and related to meditation, mindfulness and yoga. Majority of the images have also some relation to nature to give the feeling of calm and relaxtion while users browse the website.
