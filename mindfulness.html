                <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
                <p>Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, 
                and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around. <br>
                Mindfulness is a quality that every human being already possesses, it’s not something you have to conjure up, 
                you just have to learn how to access it.
