                <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
                <p>Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re
                    doing,
                    and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around.<br>
                    Mindfulness is a quality that every human being already possesses, it’s not something you have to
                    conjure up,
                    you just have to learn how to access it.

                <div class="left-tips-heading">
                    <h3>Free yourself from the past and future <i class="fab fa-pagelines"></i></h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>You can practise mindfulness anywhere, but it can be especially helpful to take a mindful 
                        approach if you realise that, for several minutes, you have been "trapped" in reliving past problems 
                        or "pre-living" future worries.

                <div class="left-tips-heading">
                    <h3>Name thoughts and feelings <i class="fas fa-brain"></i></h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>To develop an awareness of thoughts and feelings, some people find it helpful to silently name 
                        them: "Here's the thought that I might fail that exam". Or, "This is anxiety".

                    <h3>Keep it regular <i class="far fa-clock"></i> </h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>It can be helpful to pick a regular time – the morning journey to work or a walk at 
                        lunchtime – during which you decide to be aware of the sensations created by the world around you.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Notice the everyday <i class="far fa-calendar"></i> </h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Even as we go about our daily lives, we can notice the sensations of things, the food we eat, 
                        the air moving past the body as we walk," says Professor Williams. "All this may sound very small, 
                        but it has huge power to interrupt the 'autopilot' mode we often engage day to day, and to give us 
                        new perspectives on life."
