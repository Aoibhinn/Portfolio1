            <h2>Why Learn to Meditate?</h2>
            <p>While meditation isn’t a cure-all, it can certainly provide some much-needed space in your life.
                Sometimes, that’s all we need to make better choices for ourselves, our families, and our communities.
                And the most important tools you can bring with you to your meditation practice are a little patience,
                some kindness for yourself, and a comfortable place to sit. <br><br>

                When we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives.
                And bonus: you don’t need any extra gear or an expensive membership.

                <h3>Loving-kindness meditation</h3> <br>
                <p>Loving-kindness meditation also known as Metta Meditation. It's goal is to cultivate an attitude of
                    love and kindness towards everything, even a persons enemies and sources of stress. <br><br>
                    While breathing deeply, practitioners open their minds to receiving loving kindness.
                    They then send messages of loving kindness to the world, to specific people, or to their loved ones.

                <h3>Body scan or progressive relaxation</h3><br>
                <p>Progressive relaxation, sometimes called body scan meditation, is meditation that encourages people
                    to
                    scan their bodies for areas of tension. The goal is to notice tension and to allow it to release.
                    <br><br>
                    During a progressive relaxation session, practitioners start at one end of their body, usually their
                    feet, and work through the whole.

                <h3>Breath awareness meditation</h3><br>
                <p>Breath awareness is a type of mindful meditation that encourages mindful breathing.
                    <br><br>

                    Practitioners breathe slowly and deeply, counting their breaths or otherwise focusing on
                    their breaths. The goal is to focus only on breathing and to ignore other thoughts that
                    enter the mind.

                <h3>Zen meditation</h3><br>
                <p>Zen meditation, sometimes called Zazen is a form of meditation that can be part of Buddhist practice.
                    Many Zen practitioners study under a teacher because this kind of meditation involves specific steps
                    and postures.
                    <br><br>

                    The goal is to find a comfortable position, focus on breathing, and mindfully observe one’s
                    thoughts without judgment.</p>
